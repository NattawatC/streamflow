This web application makes it easy to track and manage electricity and water use in apartments. It reads meter data automatically using image processing and OCR, so no more manual checks. Residents can see their usage, pay bills, and stay on top of things, while owners can manage accounts and confirm payments all in one place. Simple, clear, and convenient for everyone.
