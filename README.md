### 🏠 Home
The owner can view all tenants belonging to their dormitory, including each tenant's name, assigned room, and rental cost. Additionally, each tenant card displays a badge indicating the room details' completion status (green for complete, red for incomplete) as well as the payment status, showing whether the tenant has paid and uploaded the receipt for verification.

### 🚰 Meter
On this page, the owner sets up the meters by linking them to their respective room numbers. When the camera captures an image of a meter, the system automatically reads the value and saves it to the database. After verification, the owner can toggle the button in the top-right corner to mark the meter as ready for use in all rooms.
